**Prefab** is a Minecraft mod, a collection of functional and aesthetic buildings that you can place into your world instantly! With our instant houses and structures, you can skip over the time consuming job of landscaping, and trying to build without a creeper undoing your work. Our preview function lets you see the structure in the world, and move through a projection of it in real time.  Just pick the place you want to put it, and the Prefab Blueprints do the rest!  Whether you haven't got the time, patience or will, we've got structures that are guaranteed to please some of you, but not all of you. :)

The building designs are pre-determined (hence the pre-fabrication idea) but can have small pieces of configuration.
You can use this in any mod pack. Please provide feedback on additional structures to add (using vanilla blocks/items is preferred). If you find issues please let me know.
